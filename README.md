# CommandLineGames
Project to get better at coding while recreating classic games as console games.

At the moment I'm doing these programs I'm still a student and haven't studied or practised any game engine.

### Planned games are listed below:
  - **Snake** (in bug fixing process)
  - **Minesweeper** (to be done)
  - **Pong** (to be done)
  - **Tetris** (to be done)
